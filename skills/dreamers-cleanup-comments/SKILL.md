description: "Project-wide comment cleanup pass per comment-rules.md. Audit → propose → user approval → apply inline → optional Sentinel review. Use when the user asks for dreamers-cleanup-comments, clean up comments, audit comments, remove fluff comments."

## Codex runtime
Before executing this skill, apply the Codex runtime mapping from `../dreamers/refs/codex-runtime.md` when this package is used as a plugin, or from `$CODEX_HOME/dreamers/refs/codex-runtime.md` when installed directly. Treat the user's message as the former command arguments. Use normal Codex tools, `update_plan` for parent progress tracking, direct user questions for approval gates, and `multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent` only for Dreamers workflows that explicitly call for delegated reviewer, documentarian, or researcher roles.

# Comment Rules

## Core principle
Comments must add value that the code cannot express itself. Concise, no fluff, no separators — value only.

## When to comment
- Non-obvious logic: why a non-obvious approach was chosen, constraints, gotchas
- Public API documentation callers need to use the interface correctly
- TODO/FIXME with specific, actionable notes
- License headers

## When NOT to comment
- Code that reads naturally from well-named functions and variables
- Anything that restates what the code obviously does (`const isRunning` does not need `// tracks whether running`)

## Strict prohibitions
- **No plan/ticket references** — never mention plan files, milestone names (D25, plan-3), ticket numbers, or agent names in source code
- **No separator comments** — never use `// ---`, `// ===`, `// ###`, blank-comment lines, or visual dividers
- **No spec rationalization** — never write comments arguing a spec permits a pattern; implement cleanly and let review judge
- **No redundant JSDoc/KDoc** that only repeats the function signature
- **No em dashes. no exceptions**

## Style
- One line when possible; never exceed two lines for inline comments
- Write *why*, never *what*
- If a comment requires more than two lines to be useful, the code needs refactoring, not more words
</comment-rules>

# Dreamers Kernel

## Subagent allowlist (HARD RULE)

Do not use any non-Dreamers agent unless explicitly authorized by user.

## Subagent prompt — required content

Every `multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent` invocation MUST include in the prompt:
- **Context** — what this agent is being asked to do and why
- **Prior work** — what was done previously, with absolute paths to any output files
- **What is needed** — specific deliverable
- **Constraints** — hard rules the agent must not violate
- **Definition of Done** — how to know the work is complete
- **Plan file path** — absolute path to the relevant plan file (if applicable)
- **Mandatory line:** `Do NOT call update_plan. The parent Dreamers skill owns the plan.`

After spawning a required Dreamers role, call `multi_agent_v1.wait_agent` when that result is needed before continuing.

## Continuation principle

At every natural pause between phases — where the skill has produced a meaningful result and the user could redirect — ask the user with three choices: `Continue` / `Halt for now` / `Other` (freeform). Never silently advance; never silently stop. On `Halt`, emit a one-line resume command and stop.

## Implementation discipline

- **Plan adherence:** edit only files in the plan's scope. No while-I'm-here cleanup, no unrelated refactors mixed with feature work.
- **No spec-arguing comments:** never add a code comment that argues the spec permits a pattern.
- **Branch identity check:** before the first edit, `git log --oneline -3`. Confirm the branch and recent commits match the expected feature. If not, halt and surface.
- **No dependency installs without permission.** Don't run `npm install`, `pip install`, etc. without explicit user approval.
- **Type-check before declaring implementation done.** Run the project's type-check command from `AGENTS.md, CODEX.md, or .github/copilot-instructions.md when present` and fix errors before moving on.

## Commit trailer

Every commit body includes:

```
Co-authored-by: The Dreamers System
```
</dreamers-kernel>

Skill input: use the user's message, including any paths or flags.

## Todo list

At skill entry, declare via `update_plan`:
- [ ] Phase 1 — audit comment-rules violations
- [ ] Phase 2 — proposal + user approval
- [ ] Phase 3 — apply cleanup inline
- [ ] Phase 4 — optional Sentinel review (if requested)
- [ ] Phase 5 — commit

Mark each item `in_progress` when starting, `completed` when done. Never batch completions at the end.

---

## Phase 1 — Audit

Scope: project source root by default; `--scope <path>` to restrict.

Walk the scope and identify each comment-rules violation. Categorize:
- **Redundant** — restates what code already says.
- **Separator** — visual dividers / `// ---` style.
- **Reference** — plan / ticket / agent / milestone string in source.
- **Spec-rationalization** — comments arguing the spec permits a pattern.
- **Redundant docstring** — JSDoc/KDoc that just mirrors the signature.
- **Excessive length** — inline comment > 2 lines.

Produce a count per category in chat + paths of the worst offenders.

## Phase 2 — Proposal + user approval

Present in chat: total comment removals, summary by category, list of files most-affected.

Ask the user with `["Approved — apply cleanup", "Halt for now", "Other"]`. Freeform corrections (e.g., "preserve license headers in src/vendor/") go through Other.

- Approved → proceed to Phase 3.
- Halt for now → output "Audit complete. No changes applied. Resume by re-invoking `dreamers-cleanup-comments`." and stop.
- Corrections → revise proposal; re-present.

## Phase 3 — Apply

Edit files inline; stage with `git add`. Follow `dreamers-kernel.md` implementation discipline: only edit files in scope; no while-I'm-here changes to actual logic.

Run the project's type-check command after edits (comments don't usually affect type-check but verify).

## Phase 4 — Optional Sentinel review

Ask the user with `["Yes — review before commit", "No — skip review", "Other"]`. Sentinel's maintainability lens catches anything the cleanup missed or newly-introduced ambiguity.

- Yes → spawn a sub-agent with `dreamers/agents/sentinel.md` and changed-files scope. Apply findings inline.
- No → proceed to commit.

## Phase 5 — Commit

`git status` to confirm staged content. Commit message: `chore: comment cleanup per comment-rules.md`. Do NOT push.
